              The Civic Type R has been an icon especially to Honda Civic
              fanatics. A little history about the "Type R" badge is it was
              based on the Generation 6 of the Honda Civic namely Civic
              <strong>"EK"</strong>. The engine of the first Type R is a B16B
              engine. It is a naturally aspirated engine that 182

              The interior also contains a bucket Recaro seats and a Type R red
              floor mats. A similar of this was released in Asia which is named
              Honda Civic SIR which has the same engine but can be also a daily
              driven car.

              Now, the Civic Type R has come a long way from its predecessor. In
              fact, it once held a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring"
                >Nurbrugring</a

              record of <strong>7-minute, 43.8 second lap</strong> beating the
              record of Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport S. It is also important to
              note that the Civic Type R is a front wheel drive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dubbed as the <q>ultimate</q> and <q>must have</q> of the civic
              enthusiast, it is clearly priced above your normal daily drives.
              At the Philippines, it is priced as 3.6 million or 89000

              priced hald around 36,000 to 44,000
              <abbr title="Canadian Dollar">cad</abbr>. Still, with that price
              civic enthusiast will still buy one as for them it is already a
              way of life.
